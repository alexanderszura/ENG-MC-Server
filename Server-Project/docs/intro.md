## üìù Project Overview

This project involved setting up a **locally hosted Minecraft server** on a desktop computer and configuring it for stable, long-term operation. The server is designed to automatically **back up world data every 15 minutes**, even while running, using **Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)**. To ensure consistent access, a **router was configured** to assign a **static IP** to the host machine and forward the server port (25565), allowing other devices on the local network to connect easily. The setup emphasizes **automation, networking, and system reliability**, making it a practical application of computer engineering skills.
